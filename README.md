This repository contains my solutions to problems from the Love Babbar DSA sheet. Each solution includes the problem statement, code implementation in Java, and time/space complexity analysis. 

I'm working through these problems to strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Arrays Problems :
  1. Reverse an Array/String
  2. Minimum and Maximum Element in Array
  3. K'th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array
  4. Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s
  5. Move All Negative Numbers to Beginning and Positive to End
  6. Union and Intersection of Two Unsorted Arrays
  7. Cyclic Rotate an Array
  8. Maximum Subarray Sum
  9. Minimize the Maximum Difference Between Heights
  10. Minimum Number of Jumps to Reach End
